# Stats-preview-card-component

Things I learned from this challenge: 
- `picture` and `source` html tags
- applying `mix-blend-mode: multiply` css property on a CHILD element inside PARENT element with a background propery `background-color`
- `display: block;` takes all the place that is possible
